Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:
"gnu8"

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "gnu8"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string
#%Module




Note: the module "openmpi3/3.1.4" cannot be unloaded because it was not loaded.
